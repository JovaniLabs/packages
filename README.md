"For this problem, equally as important as finding the packages is the process that you use to do so. In log.sql, keep a log of all SQL queries that you run on the database. Above each query, label each with a comment: in SQL, comments are any lines that begin with --, per the below:

-- This is a SQL comment
The comment should describe why you’re running the query and what information you’re hoping to get out of that particular query. You can use also comments to add additional notes about your thought process as you solve each mystery: ultimately, this file should serve as evidence of the process you used to find each package!

Once you find the location of a package, complete each of the lines in answers.txt by filling in details about the location of the package, as well as its contents. Be sure not to change any of the existing text in the file or to add any other lines to the file!"


"THE LOST LETTER"

"Your first report of a missing package comes from Anneke. Anneke walks up to your counter and tells you the following:

Clerk, my name’s Anneke. I live over at 900 Somerville Avenue. Not long ago, I sent out a special letter. It’s meant for my friend Varsha. She’s starting a new chapter of her life at 2 Finnegan Street, uptown. (That address, let me tell you: it was a bit tricky to get right the first time.) The letter is a congratulatory note—a cheery little paper hug from me to her, to celebrate this big move of hers. Can you check if it’s made its way to her yet?"

"THE DEVIOUS DELIVERY"

"Your second report of a missing package comes from a mysterious fellow from out of town. They walk up to your counter and tell you the following:

Good day to you, deliverer of the mail. You might remember that not too long ago I made my way over from the town of Fiftyville. I gave a certain box into your reliable hands and asked you to keep things low. My associate has been expecting the package for a while now. And yet, it appears to have grown wings and flown away. Ha! Any chance you could help clarify this mystery? Afraid there’s no “From” address. It’s the kind of parcel that would add a bit more… quack to someone’s bath times, if you catch my drift."

"THE FORGOTTEN GIFT"

"Your third report of a missing package comes from a grandparent who lives down the street from the post office. They approach your counter and tell you the following:

Oh, excuse me, Clerk. I had sent a mystery gift, you see, to my wonderful granddaughter, off at 728 Maple Place. That was about two weeks ago. Now the delivery date has passed by seven whole days and I hear she still waits, her hands empty and heart filled with anticipation. I’m a bit worried wondering where my package has gone. I cannot for the life of me remember what’s inside, but I do know it’s filled to the brim with my love for her. Can we possibly track it down so it can fill her day with joy? I did send it from my home at 109 Tileston Street."
